# Portfolio Project: Brain Cancer classification using a hybrid quantum Classical model <ðŸ§ |1>

Brain Tunor Detection is a development of a website linked to a quantum network. The goal of our project is to eventually deploy on our server a link with a neuronal network developed that helps it to detect the major types of tumor, analyzed and provide it with the result. 

## Functionalities of this application:
* Retrieve patient X-ray image
* Analyze the image and do some operations on it
* predict the result and display it
* Update the database
