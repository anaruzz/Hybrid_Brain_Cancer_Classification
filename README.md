# ![](https://github.com/ggirlk/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/master/holberton-logo.png?raw=true) Portfolio Project: Brain Cancer Classification with QML <üß†|1>

![](goal.png)

## ü§ñ Intro

>> Our project is a work of three teammates, manchened at the end of this document.
We've used a new method Called Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model which is a mixe between Quantum Circuits used as Neural Network and a Classical Neural Network,
Our Solution is about Brain Cancer Classification that means Classifying different Tumor types from MRI pictures so a Convolutional Neural Network is a normal method but here we did it with an Hybrid Quantum ConvNet as designed above:

## üëâ Process:
* Retrieve patient MRI image
* Process the image
* predict the result and display it
* Update the database 

## üëâ Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS using python3 (V 3.8.3)


## üëâ Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/ggirlk/Brain_Cancer_Classification.git"`
* Access deployment directory: `cd deployment`
* Run the command: `python manage.py runserver`
* Browse your MRI  and wait for the result
