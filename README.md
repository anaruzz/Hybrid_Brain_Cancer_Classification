# Portfolio Project: Brain Cancer classification using a hybrid quantum Classical model <ðŸ§ |1>

Brain Tunor Detection is a development of a website linked to a quantum network. The goal of our project is to eventually deploy on our server a link with a neuronal network developed that helps it to detect the major types of tumor, analyzed and provide it with the result. 

## Functionalities of this application:
* Retrieve patient X-ray image
* Analyze the image and do some operations on it
* predict the result and display it
* Update the database

## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)


## Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/ggirlk/Brain_Cancer_Classification.git"`
* Access deployment directory: `cd deployment`
* Run the command: `python manage.py runserver`
* Browse your X-ray  and wait for the result

## Technology

* Quantum computing
Our project we chose to work with quantum computing, a new but efficient technology, with a high precision rate.
Quantum computing, uses quantum bits or qubits. It harnesses the unique ability of subatomic particles which allows them to 
exist in more than one state ( 1 and a 0 at the same time).
<p>qbits:</p>
The basic unit of information in quantum computing.which represents the state of a quantum particle. Because of superposition, qubits can either be 1 or 0 or anything in between.
<p>Gates:</p>
a quantum gate is a basic quantum circuit operating on a number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits.

* Python / Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design
